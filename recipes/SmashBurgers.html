<br><p>A smash burger is a burger thatâ€™s made by smashing two thin beef patties together with cheese in the middle.
    The act of pressing the burgers together over heat creates a perfect sear on the outside, ensuring juicy and flavorful results every time. </p>
<h2>Ingredients list</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
    <li>4 (6-inch) squares parchment paper</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
    <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.
    </p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.
    </p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each.
        Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly.
        Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula;
        re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.
        You may also use the bottom of small skillet.
        Sprinkle the meat with salt.
    </p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color.
        Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.
        Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks.
        Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
